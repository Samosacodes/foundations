    <h1>Bad example of a Social Worker</h1>
        <div class="maindiv">
            <article>
            <p>I never imagined that asking someone to return a borrowed shirt could escalate into a traumatic experience, but that’s exactly what happened to me. The person in question is studying to become a social worker—a profession dedicated to helping others. Yet, instead of showing understanding, he reacted with aggression.
            It all started when I asked him to give back the shirt he had borrowed. What followed was an unexpected confrontation about snack wrappers on the dining table—wrappers that weren’t even mine. I tried to explain that since we all share the rent, it seemed reasonable for personal items to be there. But my words seemed to fall on deaf ears.
            As tensions rose, he crossed a line. He grabbed me by the waist, and despite my desperate attempts to free myself, we tumbled onto a bed. In that vulnerable moment, when I was just trying to escape his grasp, he punched me near my eye. This act of violence was particularly harrowing because I’ve been struggling with vision issues since arriving in Canada. Everyone, including him, knew about my condition, making his actions even more cruel.
            This experience has left me shaken and disillusioned. It’s deeply unsettling to think that someone in a position to care for others could act with such brutality. This situation has reinforced the need to address and confront harmful behaviors, especially when they come from individuals in caregiving professions. We trust these professionals to support and protect us, not to cause harm.
            It’s vital that we hold people in these roles accountable and ensure they uphold the values they are supposed to represent. My hope is that sharing my story will bring more attention to this issue and contribute to a broader conversation about the responsibilities and ethical standards expected from those in caregiving roles.</p>
